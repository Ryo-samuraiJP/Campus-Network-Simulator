# Campus-Network-Simulator

Campus Network Simulator is my network project, in which I designed and implemented a comprehensive network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project involves creating and demonstrating a complex network topology with multiple buildings on the university campus, a centralized data center, and interconnecting routers, with a focus on features as below, showcasing my network knowledge and design skills.

## Features
- Specific **IP Addressing** schemes were devised for each building along with appropriate device selection, including PCs, switches, serves, and routers. 
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols** were implemented to enable efficient packet routing between different networks.
- The network design addressed various requirements, including **network segmentation**, **efficient IP management**, and **seamless inter-building communication**.
